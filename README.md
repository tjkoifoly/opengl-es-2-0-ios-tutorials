So you’re here to learn OpenGL ES 2.0? Great, it’s a lot of fun! Many people say that learning OpenGL is difficult, but all things in life are difficult before we know them, right? All you need is some patience. I know there are quite a few tutorials on this topic out there already, but I’m sure there is room for another. I remember being new to OpenGL myself, and I know how difficult it can appear in the beginning. Have faith, though! It’s extremely rewarding once you’re starting to grasp it.
